The `draw_square` method uses the `create_polygon` method to draw a square on the canvas, and the `rotate_points` method applies a rotation transformation to the square's coordinates. The `rotate` method updates the angle of rotation and calls `draw_square` repeatedly with a small delay to create the animation effect.\\n\\nFeel free to ask if you need any additional information on this code!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"parent_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 215,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"043a035e-7e17-41c0-b39b-840e0e3e87ae\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"parent_role\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"prompter\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"parent_labels_toxicity_value\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.38065809038912835,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.625\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"parent_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 215,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"What's a good weight lifting plan to build muscle for someone with a lower back injury?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
